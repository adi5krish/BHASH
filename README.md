# BHASH
This project is a part of course project - Compiler Design offered in SPRING 2018 where we are asked to design a language of our own and 
perform syntax and semantic analysis for the same. Although, we were successful in doing syntax analysis, we could only manage to perform 
semantic analysis for a fair amount of constructs we have defined for our language. The name we chose for this language is "BHASH".

The repo also consists of sample programs along with the lex and yacc files we made that ran as per the constructs we defined. The sample 
programs file contains example programs that were successfully compiled and executed with our language.
